Linux postexploitation tool for discovery, backdooring, and lateral movement.

##goals
* run independently of the host environment (no dependence on existing executable utilities, e.g. python, ruby, find). Ideal for use in containers.
* run with minimal liklihood of detection (no execution of potentially detectable commands, e.g. netstat, lsof, who)
* run fast (parallelized native code)

## discovery
* grab a snapshot of host activity like processes, net connections, arp cache, logged in users, more
* ... do the above over a period of time to get a sense of how the machine is used and by whom
* detect security controls: A/V & auditd rules
* grab ssh keys
* serialize discovery data as JSON for easy consumption later

## backdoor
* modify user's ssh config to force user to enable connection sharing (ControlMaster) when ssh'ing to remote hosts

## lateral movement
* piggy back on forwarded ssh credentials (ssh-agent reuse)
* piggy back on existing ssh connections that have connection sharing enabled (ssh connection reuse)


## examples
### discovery
* See what AV systems we can detect:
    ```bash
>: go run snappy.go --av  | jq '.[] | select(.Name == "Antivirus")|.Values[].Name'
"OSSEC"
"Sophos"
"Tripwire"
"Samhain"
>:
```

* See who's logged into the system and scope the JSON:
    ```bash
>: go run snappy.go --who
```
    ```json
    [
      {
        "Name": "Who",
        "Values": [
          {
            "User": "neo",
            "Line": ":0",
            "Host": ":0",
            "Pid": 6348,
            "Time": 1467851439
          },
          {
            "User": "wrabbit",
            "Line": "pts/4",
            "Host": ":0",
            "Pid": 31267,
            "Time": 1467853536
          },
          {
            "User": "morph",
            "Line": "pts/15",
            "Host": ":0",
            "Pid": 31267,
            "Time": 1467913627
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
```
